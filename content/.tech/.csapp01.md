#### 十六进制快速写出二进制

0 - 9 binary
#### 1010 is a     
1011 is b
#### 1100 is c  

1101 is d 

1110 is e

#### 1111 is f     

a byte is 8 bits

and so C rather than a sort of an advanced thing

#### **bool operation, logic operation, bit operation, shift operation**

so just as a bit of history it was a master's degree student at MIT named Claude Shannon,
who had taken a course in logic as an undergranduate at University of Michigan

'& , | , ^ , ~' bitmap

01101001      
76543210    

{0, 3, 5, 6}

use 1 assign the key number

don't mix up & and &&
& is bit operators , but && is logic operator


shift operation:
1. logical shift
2. arithmetic shift
